# Abls-Habitat Static Files

**Abls-Habitat Static** is part of [Abls-Habitat Project](https://docs.abls-habitat.fr).
This software is **Work In Progress**.
It is a complete refund of built-in GUI from [Watchdog Project](https://github.com/sebaru/Watchdog)

This repository share all static files like logos ans icons used in the new GUI.

Maybe one of you may help if interested, especially in SVG design.

I'm developing on my sparse-time, not so easy with one little kid at home :-).

Have a good day,
Sebaru.
